Our project requires python-2.7, django 1.10.2, django-nose 1.4.4, and django-autofixture 0.12.1

Python 2.7 can be installed using a package manager.
The remaining packages can be installed using pip ('pip install django', 'pip install django-nose', 'pip install django-autofixture')

The code can be run after cloning by:
 1. calling 'python manage.py runserver'
 2. navigating to localhost:8000/ in a web browser
 3. username 'test' and password 'test' can be used to login

Unit tests can be run with 'python manage.py test'. This will run all of the unit tests and a 'cover' directory will be created with the code coverage statistics.
